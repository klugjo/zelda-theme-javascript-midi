### Zelda Music Theme Generator

Developed for Zelda's 30th anniversary.

This is a short program that will generate a MIDI file with Zelda's main theme, all in JavaScript.

It makes use of the excellent [MidiWriterJS](https://github.com/grimmdude/MidiWriterJS) library.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/klugjo/zelda-theme-javascript-midi
cd zelda-theme-javascript-midi
npm install
npm start
```
